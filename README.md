## ðŸŒ±My Philosophy

I maintain a humble attitude as I continue to explore and learn about technology.<br>
Sharing my acquired knowledge with others brings me a sense of fulfillment.<br>

## ðŸŽ¯ 2023 Goals

I've been learning Java for 6 months, and I plan to continue building a solid foundation in it. I'll be revisiting and reinforcing the basics while also working on problem-solving exercises. In the future, I intend to delve into other modules of Spring and explore Docker.

I'm planning to continue learning English and it's part of my future goals.
